# # Programming in Python
# ## Exam: July 19, 2021
#
#
# You can solve the exercises below by using standard Python 3.9 libraries, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, PyMC3.
# You can browse the documentation: [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.9/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/contents.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/1.2.5/), [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/).
# You can also look at the [slides of the course](https://homes.di.unimi.it/monga/lucidi2021/pyqb00.pdf) or your code on [GitHub](https://github.com).

# ### Exercise 1 (max 3 points)
#
# Consider a bidimensional grid with 33x33 dots. Plot the dots.

pass

# ### Exercise 2 (max 5 points)
#
# On the grid defined in Exercise 1, compute 5 random walks, starting in the central dot, going on for 100 steps of 1 in the horizontal, vertical or both directions. When a walk reaches the border of the grid, it starts again on the opposite side: in other words, on a line of dots to the left of the leftmost dot there is the rightmost one; same on the right, above, and below.

pass

# ### Exercise 3 (max 3 points)
#
# Plot the walks computed in Exercise 2.

pass

# ### Exercise 4 (max 7 points)
#
# Define a function that takes two random walks and computes a new one. The resulting walk:
# - has a length equal to the sum of the lengths of the given walks minus one
# - the first half is the first given
# - the second half is the second given, traslated such as the first step is applied to the last position of the first given walk
#
# For example: if the two walks are `[(0,0), (1,1)]` and `[(0,0), (0,-1)]`, the resulting walk will be `[(0,0), (1,1), (1,0)]`
#
#
# To get the full marks, you should declare correctly the type hints (the signature of the function) and add a doctest string.

pass

# ### Exercise 5 (max 2 points)
#
# Load the data contained in the file `iris.csv` in a Pandas DataFrame.

pass

# ### Exercise 6 (max 3 points)
#
#
# Add to the dataframe two columns for the ratio between width and length, for petals and sepals.

pass

# ### Exercise 7 (max 5 points)
#
# Plot the histograms of the sepal ratio computed in Exercise 6 for each iris class. Put the three plots in a single chart.

pass

# ### Exercise 8 (max 5 points)
#
# Consider this statistical model: the sepal ratio of Iris-setosa and Iris-virginica is normally distributed, with an unknown mean, and a standard deviation of 1. Your *a priori* estimation of the mean for both distribution is a normal distribution with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.1. Use PyMC to sample the posterior distributions after having seen the actual values for Iris-setosa and Iris-virginica.  Plot the results.
